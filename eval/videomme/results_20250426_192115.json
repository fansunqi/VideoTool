However, the context of the Roman Republic and its military actions suggests that events related to military conflicts and political maneuvers were common during that time.\n\nGiven that the options relate to events that could be associated with the Roman Republic's military activities, it is important to note that the Roman Republic was in power before 72 BCE, and various military engagements occurred during that period. However, without specific historical references to the events listed in the options, it is not possible to definitively state which of the events happened before 72 BCE based solely on the frame information provided.\n\nIf I had to choose based on the general context of Roman military history, I would lean towards option A, \"The Senate retaliated with the full force of two legions,\" as it aligns with the military actions typical of the Roman Republic era.

            "According to the 'step-up in basis' rule, the cost basis of the stock is adjusted to its market value at the time of Emily's death in 2020, which was $150 per share. Therefore, when John sells the stock for $180 per share in 2023, the capital gains tax is calculated based on the difference between the sale price and the stepped-up basis.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\n1. Sale Price: $180 per share\n2. Stepped-Up Basis: $150 per share\n3. Capital Gain: $180 - $150 = $30 per share\n4. Capital Gains Tax Rate: 15%\n5. Capital Gains Tax: $30 x 0.15 = $4.50 per share\n\nThus, the correct answer is **A. $4.5 per share**."

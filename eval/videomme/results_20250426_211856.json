            "Based on the images provided, the video seems to cover historical events related to William the Conqueror. Here's an analysis of the options:\n\nA. His eldest son succeeded him as King of England - This is true. William's eldest son, Robert, did not succeed him as King of England; it was his second son, William II (William Rufus).\n\nB. He died on Sept. 9th - This is incorrect. William the Conqueror died on September 9, 1087.\n\nC. His army killed Harold at Standford Bridge - This is incorrect. Harold Godwinson was killed at the Battle of Hastings, not Stamford Bridge.\n\nD. He lose the battle of Hastings - This is incorrect. William won the Battle of Hastings in 1066.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is B. He died on Sept. 9th."

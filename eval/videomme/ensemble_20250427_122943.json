Roughly 30% of all northern Europeans were dying of TB, most of them were artists and writers - This statement is not supported by the provided information.\n\nB. The consumption was thought to be only prevalent in white people - This statement is contradicted by the quote in Frame 38680, which indicates that TB was also a concern for other demographics.\n\nC. TB was incurable - The frames do not provide information to confirm or deny this statement.\n\nD. Southern California came to be known as \"the land of new lungs\" for the reason that the air there can heal TB diseases - This statement is not supported by the provided information.\n\nThe most accurate conclusion based on the information is that option B is incorrect, as the quote suggests that TB was not thought to be limited to white people.

However, since the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. He died on Sept. 9th - This is incorrect; he died on September 9, 1087.\nC.

The correct answer should reflect that William II succeeded him, not his eldest son."

However, we can analyze the statements based on general knowledge of the themes often associated with Goya's works and the mythological figures of the Fates:\n\nA. The extra man sitting among the Fates might be Goya himself - This statement could be plausible if the painting includes a self-portrait, but without specific information from the frames, we cannot confirm this.\n\nB. Clotho was holding the thread of life in the painting - This is consistent with the traditional role of Clotho, one of the Fates, who spins the thread of life.\n\nC. The painting expresses Goya's helplessness and unwillingness towards his children's death - This statement could be true if the painting reflects Goya's personal experiences, but again, we have no specific information to confirm this.\n\nD. Atropos was carrying scissors, deciding whether to cut the thread of life - This is also consistent with the traditional role of Atropos, who is known for cutting the thread of life.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the painting \"altropos (the fates)\" in the frame descriptions, it is difficult to definitively identify which statement is incorrect. However, if we must choose one based on general knowledge, option A could be considered the least likely to be correct, as it is less commonly associated with the traditional depictions of the Fates compared to the other statements. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nA. The extra man sitting among the Fates might be Goya himself."
